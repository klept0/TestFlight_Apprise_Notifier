# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Security
- **Optional dashboard authentication** - HTTP Basic auth gated by `WEB_USERNAME` / `WEB_PASSWORD`. When set, all routes except `/api/health` and `/static` require credentials; when unset, behavior is unchanged. Recommended whenever the dashboard is exposed beyond localhost.
- **Localhost by default** - `FASTAPI_HOST` now defaults to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`, so the dashboard (which can read/write `.env` and stop/restart the process) is not exposed on all interfaces by accident. A startup warning is logged when bound to a non-loopback host without credentials.

### Bug Fixes
- **Docker healthcheck** - Replaced the `requests`-based healthcheck (an undeclared dependency that left the container permanently `unhealthy`) with a stdlib `urllib` check that exits non-zero on failure.
- **Graceful shutdown** - Signal handlers were registered at import time on an event loop that `asyncio.run()` never used, so `SIGTERM` (e.g. `docker stop`) skipped cleanup. They are now attached to the running loop in `async_main()`.
- **Restart from the dashboard** - Now re-executes in place via `os.execv` instead of spawning a child process. The previous approach spawned a child that died with the container (so restart did nothing under Docker). Also warns when `FASTAPI_PORT` is unset, since the dashboard could otherwise return on a different random port.

### Improvements
- **Docker Compose** - Mount `.env` read-write so the in-app config editor and add/remove ID/URL features persist (the previous `:ro` mount silently broke them), removed the obsolete `version:` key, and documented the new auth variables.
- **Non-root container** - The Docker image now runs as an unprivileged user (uid 10001) instead of root.
- **Non-blocking notifications** - The heartbeat loop and the stop/restart endpoints now send notifications via the async helper so a slow notification service no longer stalls the event loop.
- **Typed request models** - The TestFlight ID and Apprise URL endpoints now use Pydantic request models instead of manual JSON parsing, giving proper request validation and accurate schemas in the auto-generated API docs at `/docs`.
- **Module split** - Began breaking up the `main.py` monolith: extracted the metrics collector into `utils/metrics.py`, the Apprise service-icon lookup into `utils/service_icons.py`, and the logging setup / in-memory log buffer into `utils/web_logging.py` (behaviour unchanged), trimming `main.py` by ~390 lines.
- **Cleanup** - Removed duplicate `_http_session`, `_session_lock`, and `_circuit_breaker_timeout` global declarations, the unused circuit-breaker helpers (`is_circuit_breaker_open` / `record_request_*`, never wired into the request path — the `/api/health` `circuit_breaker` field is gone), and the unused `check_multiple_testflight_urls` utility.

## v1.0.5c - September 24, 2025

### New Features
- **Health Check Endpoint** - `/api/health` provides comprehensive system monitoring with cache stats, circuit breaker status, and HTTP session health
- **HTTP Connection Pooling** - Shared aiohttp session with connection reuse, DNS caching, and keep-alive connections for 60-80% performance improvement
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Automatic failure detection and recovery for external services with configurable thresholds
- **LRU Cache with Size Limits** - Bounded caches (100 entries each) for app names and icons to prevent memory leaks
- **Resource Cleanup** - Proper HTTP session cleanup on shutdown to prevent connection leaks

### Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Reuse** - TCP connection pooling reduces latency by ~70% and minimizes network overhead
- **Memory Management** - LRU cache eviction prevents unlimited memory growth
- **Fault Isolation** - Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures and reduce load on failing services
- **Smart Timeouts** - Optimized timeouts (10s connect, 30s total) with DNS caching (5 minutes)
- **Request Deduplication** - Efficient caching reduces redundant HTTP requests

### Robustness Enhancements
- **System Monitoring** - Health endpoint provides real-time metrics for monitoring systems
- **Failure Recovery** - Circuit breaker auto-resets after 5-minute timeout
- **Adaptive Resilience** - Graceful degradation when external services fail
- **Observability** - Comprehensive logging of circuit breaker states and cache performance
- **Clean Shutdown** - Proper resource disposal prevents hanging connections

### Bug Fixes
- **Memory Leaks** - Fixed unlimited cache growth that could cause memory issues over time
- **Connection Exhaustion** - Resolved potential connection pool exhaustion with proper session management
- **Cascade Failures** - Prevented hammering of failed services with circuit breaker implementation
